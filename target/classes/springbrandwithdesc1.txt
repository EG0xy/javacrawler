We hold our personal care products to a higher standard, and use the Environmental Working Group’s ratings to evaluate each and every ingredient in any product we make.

Blu Kicks|     It all started on a boat off Hawaii. Our friend Bubba spotted a humuhumunukunukuapua’a fish and said it looked like a sneaker weaving through the water.

The more we thought about it, that shoe captured the natural beauty of Hawaii and that carefree vacation vibe.

Blue is the Land|     In the case of Blue is the Land, “we” is really “me” — and “me” is Derek Howles. (How’s that for a grammatically questionable sentence?) I’m a designer from New York City who has loved geography ever since I was old enough to obsessively scour my parents’ world atlas. A few years ago I designed a series of neighborhood maps representing four of the cities where my wife and I had lived. It wasn’t long before friends and family saw them on our wall and asked if I could create versions for other cities, too. In late 2013 I started Blue is the Land to share my love of geography and design with a wider audience. I’m fascinated by how neighborhoods are formed and what they can tell us about a city. I take great care to accurately represent neighborhood names and boundaries — which means relying on personal experience, reading news stories, searching blogs and social media, scouring real estate listings, and, of course, talking to folks who actually live there. It all boils down to my ultimate goal: to design something you’ll be excited about, something that allows you to represent your favorite place with pride.

Broome & Mercer|     If the Wonders of the World made an official list of neighborhoods, New York City’s SoHo would be on it.

Cinq à Sept|     Sharing its name with the French term for the liminal moment linking late afternoon and early evening, Cinq à Sept brings the intriguing tension between day and night to a new advanced contemporary collection. Inspired by the hours between 5 and 7 p.m., when city streets are awash in the warm glow of the vanishing sun and office desks are abandoned for cocktails and as-yet unknown possibilities, Cinq à Sept embodies a deliberate balance between sophistication and ease, youthful daring and confident allure. The collection’s modern feminine aesthetic embraces unexpected details and striking silhouettes, resulting in garments that draw their romance and sexiness from the woman wearing them. Cinq à Sept debuts for Pre-Fall 2016 on our on-line boutique as well as at select locations at Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and other fine specialty stores.

DELFINA DELETTREZ|     Delfina Delettrez is a designer and jeweller based in Rome. She founded her company, Delfina Delettrez, in 2007. Since the inception of her brand, she has developed a signature perspective using a wide material vocabulary, manifested in her original use of figurative surrealism and natural iconography including hands, eyes, bees, and lips. These adorn different parts of the anatomy, in a continuous game of echoes. Delettrez's latest work explores a more conceptual sense of the surreal: instead of adding, she now subtracts, viewing precious stones as self-sufficient in themselves and creating 'phantom settings' which give the illusion of fine jewels floating around the body. The unique aesthetic of Delettrez's work comes from the marriage of classical goldsmith techniques with innovative contemporary materials, progressing traditional Italian craftsmanship to create modern, futuristic jewels.

Recently, Dsquared2 collections have conquered a wider audience and, owing to their natural stylistic maturity, have become more chic and sophisticated while maintaining those sexy and provocative traits so embedded in their creative roots.

He formally launched his collection in spring summer 2008.

Edward Bess|     Born in Charleston, South Carolina, Edward Bess would discover his muse early on. With an innate sense of style and attention to detail, Edward has dissected beauty around him for as early as he can remember. “Even as a young boy my mother and three sisters looked to me for beauty advice – a glimpse into my future guiding women to look their best.” At age 15 on a trip to New York City, Edward auditioned for the Professional Performing Arts School to study theater. Edward’s acceptance into the famed Manhattan theater school exposed him to cultural inspirations at every turn. As Edward continued his theater studies, he was approached to consider modeling. At age 18, fully immersed in modeling, Edward moved to work in London. His days were filled with castings and photo shoots as he soaked up the adventure of living abroad. These experiences would further influence and define Edward’s style as he set out to share his vision for women. The face of beauty would be revolutionized by Edward’s next endeavor. “I decided to create a collection of lip colors that flattered all women – and would never go out of style,” he says. Assembling ten lipsticks and five glosses together in a sleek lacquer box, Edward named his first foray Lip Wardrobe. He debuted his lip colors in 2006 at Bergdorf Goodman, meeting with customers excited for his hand-picked shades. Edward’s talent and passion for beauty was clear – Lip Wardrobe sold out on its debut. As word spread, women flocked to meet the 20 year old behind the buzz and have Edward himself select their lip colors. Edward expanded his range and introduced wearable shades for the eyes and face. In 2010 Edward Bess launched at Neiman Marcus Beverly Hills, establishing the brand’s philosophy across the country. The long list of celebrity followers continued to grow. Two years after he debuted his revolutionary lip colors, Time Magazine honored Edward as one of the Top 100 People And Ideas Behind Today’s Most Influential Design (2008). Edward Bess was further recognized when chosen for Oprah’s Favorite Things (2011) accelerating the brand’s universal appeal to new heights. Edward’s passion for making the world a more beautiful place, one woman at a time, lies at the heart of his “less is more” approach to beauty.

Etro|     Etro is New Tradition, the sum of artisan know-how and creative experimentation. The venture began in 1968 when Gimmo Etro, the brand’s visionary founder, launched a production of highly prestigious fabrics, which he embellished with original designs and innovative colour ways. In 1981 the furnishing textiles line made its debut. The Paisley motif used to enrich the first collection was set to become the Etro mark of identity. The product range added another string to its bow in 1984 with leather goods and the bag collection in Paisley jacquard fabric. In 1986 Etro launched the home accessories and complements collection, consolidating the brand’s life style concept. The creation of the Etro Perfumes division in the late 1980s was a natural consequence: today the collection extends to 24 exclusive fragrances and a dedicated boutique. The 1990s saw the unveiling of Etro first men’s and women’s prêt-à-porter collections, their inventive and recherché style earning the label instant recognition.

FACTO|     I began designing shoes in New York in my mid 20s. Now, almost a decade later, I've discovered a fundamental evolution in that which I seek intellectually, spiritually and subsequently from the material realm. I began to sense that culture was becoming increasingly inundated with saccharine laden, instant gratification delights, mass produced and marketed to promote a commercial cycle of gross consumption, obsolescence and waste. While I may even partake in the occasional indulgence, I decided I wanted to invent something more substantial, more nourishing for the soul. I traveled to Tuscany, near the hometown of Leonardo da Vinci, where I found a producer making footwear for many of the world’s most storied fashion houses. At this echelon of manufacturing, I had to consider the very concept of luxury. Is it meant to be an indicator of taste or wealth? Comfort or social status? Luxury may well encompass all this, but I wondered if it could be something more. In its highest form, shouldn’t luxury be able to convey something as ethereal as spiritual status? If a pair of eyes could be the windows to the soul, why couldn’t a pair of shoes do the same? Why can’t the limitations of time itself be unlocked by thoughtful design and surpassing durability? Living amidst Japan’s culture of unforgiving standards of service and quality, it becomes easy to adopt augmented expectations of luxury. In pursuit of this form of craft, I confronted the premise that products made with quality at the core, inevitably possess a longer physical lifespan. It thus became an essential driving force behind the design, which meant the silhouettes, colors and materials used would have to transcend the cycles of trend, and defy the natural course of diminishing beauty and utility. Reinterpreting and balancing abstractions of vintage, currency and futurism became the purpose behind a product to evoke an appreciation that dares to endure years or even decades, and perhaps with age, becomes an object of even deeper affinity. In this spirit, I humbly offer FACTO.

Father's Daughter|     Jim Man and Su Kim got their start in LA’s premium denim scene. This beginning shows—they’re drawn to all things denim, and devoted to high quality. In an industry where the bottom line often wins, Father’s Daughter aims first to build up artistic confidence and foster the people behind the brand, whether it’s the wash contractor, the sewer, the intern, or the photographer. This doesn’t only make the product better: it’s just a better way to live and create. The Patternmaker: In Korea, Jim Man Kim ran a custom dress shop with his wife. His dream, like his personality, was big, so in 1991 he moved his family across the world to a place built for big things: Los Angeles. The years that followed brought the rise of premium denim and Jim started working at his first denim company, one that had birthed this new industry. He became lead patternmaker, crafting perfectly fitted jeans for Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, J Brand, and other iconic names. After carving out a niche in denim patternmaking, he opened his own workshop, “Jim’s Design Studio,” in the heart of downtown fashion district at 9th and Spring. Clients have come, and stayed, for his magic—a developed eye for balance and fit, flawless needlework samples, and readiness to combine his genius with the vision of designers. The Designer: Some would call Su Kim a 1.5-generation Korean because she moved to California when she was six years old. Growing up, she experienced the beautiful mashup of LA—liquor stores and taco trucks, luxury grocers and hipster cafes, beaches and outdoor malls. She saw how LA vibrates with all the dreams it attracts. While getting her undergrad degree in sociology, trends and the search for “newness” became the backbone of how she made sense of the world. Still, it wasn’t the career path for her. She panicked. Her father wanted to help, but he only knew one thing: fashion. So he offered Paris. Who would say no? After two years studying nouvelle couture—learning sketching, construction, draping, sewing, and how to deal with incredibly intimidating French women—Su returned to LA for a career at a major denim label. She played out her path in the design department, traveling to Asia and Europe to understand the industry’s scope and grow her technical knowledge. Yet despite such a large reach, she felt creatively cramped. She wanted to pour all of herself into a project. When she approached her dad about creating their own brand, he said he’d been waiting for her to come to this point, when she felt ready. She was ready. So they went for it—a small family team, creating something larger than themselves.

Frankie & Ava|     We believe our closets should be reflections of the journey we take, as they mirror our own story and purpose. Our passion and love for searching out fabrics and yarns has taken many years of travel and partnering. Country by country we source and develop our exclusive collection of kids' clothing. We set out to build a company that celebrates the very start of kids' lives and continues into their childhood. Frankie and Ava is our way of sharing these stories and products with you. We were determined to transform modern kids' closets. Our very first designs were created in the UK when our kids were babies and we looked for the perfect pieces that were cozy, soft and unique. We searched high and low for partners who shared our love of knitting. When we found Nicola and her team, she told us about her group, and we knew we had fallen in love with the story of their work and their passion for knitting. She grew up wearing sweaters knitted by her mother and grandmother, as we did. Living in the UK, we had our fair share of cold winters and our sweaters kept us warm and comfortable. These talented master-knitters have been knitting for their families since they were little, and these skills were passed down out of necessity to keep warm, and also to provide an income. It takes much longer than machine methods, but the techniques provide an unmatched texture and design to each individual item and their hard work and patience shines through on each final piece. We live in sunny California now, but our love and appreciation has not dwindled and I can testify that we still need some warm clothes here, as the mornings can be super-cold, so we are excited to bring these snugly items to you. ‘We strive to support these gifted artisans and keep the craft of knitting alive and help it evolve for future generations “ With love Frankie & Ava

Grayers|2794     The inspiration behind the name Grayers came about when Peter Georgiou, Grayers founder, a 10-year Ralph Lauren veteran and veritable history buff, was reading about Britain in the 1950’s. At that time, young men switched from wearing three-piece suits to gray flannel trousers, commonly known as Grayers. And the casual menswear movement was born. Grayers was the must-have in every man’s wardrobe, from British society to American prep schools. Peter saw a gap in the men's market for a well-crafted clothing collection with great fit, crazy good quality and incredibly reasonable prices. He was instantly inspired to go back and rewrite the classics in a new way, and make them uniquely Grayers.

Henry Beguelin|     In the early Eighties, a group of friends on the island of Elba started to assemble, almost by chance, belts and bags in natural cowhide and recycled materials. They created handmade, unique and now-legendary items like the Spazzatura belt, decorated with recycled waste, the Tribù belt, embroidered with a family of stylized stick figures, and the collection made using recycled cans commissioned by Comme de Garcons. This entertaining pastime took a serious turn, and the Henry Beguelin brand was born; however its spirit has never changed: objects crafted by hand with ancient mastery, timeless pieces that are always current because they go beyond the concept of short-lived “fads” to become the expression of real luxury. At first the company mainly produced belts, a few handbags and some small leather goods. Soon it added shoes, boxes and a few leather baskets, and then furniture. Recently the collections have expanded to include clothing and cashmere knitwear. The hallmark of the Henry Beguelin world is the miniature stick figure hand embroidered in the special waxed thread utilized to sew all the company’s products, the very same symbol that decorated original belts of the eighties. The eloquent ideogram that distinguished every Henry Beguelin product has become a full-fledged seal of authenticity, quality and craftsmanship.

ILA|     Rajasthan, India is known for its vast deserts and startling architecture. Cities, palaces, and forts are etched in the history of the land; and the strong structural background of the land infiltrates everyone that calls it their home. Growing up, our family would travel back to Rajasthan to visit our ancestral residence, known as a "Haveli". It has stood for over 200 hundred years and seen the birthing of our father, his father and the rest of our paternal ancestors. The Haveli has stood through a number of different rulers and eras, and captures the rich history and cultural traditions of India. It is a place enchanted by history, mysticism and beauty. Most stunning were the frescos that lined the open-air courtyard in the center of the grand house. As children, our grandfather would recount tales of ancient Indian mythology that were painted in the frescoes dotting the meticulously detailed archways that connected one edifice to another. Each edifice was carved with the most skilled hand; to tell stories of long ago. The carvings were adorned with inlaid stones; and it seemed the jewelers truly did the detailing in the building. Those trips to India created a foundation of appreciation for minute details, beautiful stones, handwork and curved lines. We learned that together, those elements told a story in themselves. Some 15 years later, after a long trip through India, we came together from opposite ends of the country to create ila&i in hopes of capturing a part of our family's heritage that we saw and imagined together when we were little.

INTER-PRET.us|     From a very young age, Creative Director Derek Guillemette inherited his love for design from his mother, who made her own clothes . He grew up fascinated by how a woman creates her very own personal style and fashion mythology through a curated wardrobe. Derek’s brainchild, INTER-PRET.us, is thus built on a versatile and simple foundation: a palette of primary colors to spread onto a canvas and create your own vision. His collections are inspired and thoughtful but never contrived, always timeless but never classic, he thrives for simplicity but is not a minimalist. He launched INTER-PRET.us in Fall 2014 after a decade working in the fashion industry as a Head Designer Buyer at Bloomingdale’s and Rent The Runway. During the course of his career he also took fashion design classes at FIT, and in 2013 sporadically bought a sewing machine and began making his own clothes. After repeated requests from friends to make them his signature ”Slim Slouch Jean” he decided to create an entire collection and brand based around the most versatile wardrobe element: the perfect black pant. The ruched front allows for a greater ease of movement, as does the stretch twill fabric from Japan used in their construction.

Isabel Marant|     It all started in 1989 when Isabel Marant launched Twen, her first knitwear and jersey brand, at 22 years old. She held her first show in her own name in 1995 in the courtyard of a squat, with her friends as models. Barely three years later, she opened her first boutique in an old artists’ workshop. Her historic location is still on rue de Charonne, in the Bastille district. Twenty-two years and twenty-two boutiques later, everything and nothing has changed…. her vision remains the same.Isabel has always had a single-minded love of fashion. By age eleven, she knew exactly what she did and did not want to wear. As a teen, she rebelled against stifling conventions and created her own look, using restyled military coats and her father’s sweaters. It was her love of clothing and materials that live and move that brought her to Studio Berçot, never to leave it. While some dream of iconic women in glossy magazines, Isabel dresses women for their real lives – walking down the street or zipping off on a scooter. She never takes a piece out of her workshop without trying it on herself. She has always encouraged handmade creations, and collection after collection has fought to keep traditional skills alive, an approach that she refers to as “the ecology of clothing”. In Paris, New York, and Hong Kong, she has remained true to her ideals, and to her staff and partners who have been with her from the start.

With a resolute determination of moving ever forward, Miyake has brought forth several epoch-making outcomes, including original pleated pieces from 1989, which would later develop into PLEATS PLEASE ISSEY MIYAKE, and the basic idea and process of A-POC in 1997, this time in collaboration with Dai Fujiwara, which would soon evolve into a design solution called A-POC INSIDE which was incorporated into the ISSEY MIYAKE collections as well as in all other brands owned by the ISSEY MIYAKE group. Placing a high value on fostering various human resources and innovative technologies in the industry since the foundation of the brand, Miyake's spirit of making things has been passed on to a new generation of designers, past and present.

K/LLER COLLECTION|     K/LLER COLLECTION is the fusion of designers KATIE DEGUZMAN and MICHAEL MILLER. The creators of K/LLER COLLECTION met in 2000 at Parsons School of Design in New York City, where they studied furniture design. Katie bought a bracelet off Michael to hide a tattoo from her mom and they've been friends ever since. After graduating, they progressed into the jewelry industry, and tracked each other throughout their growing careers. Collectively, they have designed jewelry for several private label clients. Individually, Michael and Katie forged successful careers in the field of design. Michael honed her skills working in furniture, metal restoration, and lighting, while Katie designed for Alexis Bittar, Justin Giunta for Subversive Jewelry, and more. In 2010, they joined forces and formed K/LLER COLLECTION. The aesthetic of K/LLER COLLECTION revolves around their interest in choppers, rusted tools, alchemy, and androgyny. The collection, constructed from an amalgam of oxidized, rough-hewn metals delicately cast over skeletal organic materials, vibes a raw rebellious spirit. The adornments speak of an unapologetically gutsy rebel-yell. Gritty and unfettered yet incredibly chic the pieces are subtly bohemian with a biker-chick aesthetic. Eolithic materials like fish jaws, arrowheads, horns, distressed leather, stalactites, petals, porcupine quills and feathers prove darkly enchanting and unique. K/LLER COLLECTION fuses deconstruction and sculpture, decay and renewal, androgyny and femininity, sophistication and bohemia. It is about the juxtaposition of hard and soft, the dark side clashing with the sweet, and choosing vice over virtue. Every piece of K/LLER COLLECTION is made in the U.S.A, and most pieces are handmade in Katie and Michael’s Brooklyn based studio. The majority of the jewelry is cast of 100% recycled metal and any porcupine quills and horns used are by-products from the farming industry. Their globally recognized brand has been sold in Helmut Lang international flagship stores and is currently carried in over 50 stores worldwide. In February 2013 K/LLER COLLECTION launched at Barney’s CO-OP stores. In October 2014, K/LLER COLLECTION was the grand prize winner of the CFDA/Lexus Eco-Fashion Challenge. K/M

Kempton & Co|     Fiona Kempton, designer and owner of Kempton & Co., was born in 1977 and raised in a house by the sea in the countryside of southwest England, setting the stage for a rather unique childhood and a lifetime connected to the ocean. It was due to her address, in fact, that she was introduced to sewing as Fiona's parents owned a scuba diving business. She'd often catch her father stitching wetsuits and canvas fly fishing bags, which led to her creating make up bags with fabric remnants and zippers from vintage clothes, as a child. Her father, John Kempton was formerly a racehorse trainer and jockey (winner of England's famous Grand National in 1967). John also engineered beautiful leather saddlery that Fiona believed would look exquisite as re-imagined handbags. Growing up around the distressed leather of her old riding boots and the heavy waxed canvas of the horses' rain rugs, leather straps and buckles, solidified her love for equestrian design and culture, combined with an active life on the water. Fiona continued on to study fashion design in London's Kingston University. After graduation, she moved to New York, and spent the next ten years of her life designing for major brands. As exciting as it was, Fiona missed the artistic creativity and freedom she experienced making her own bags as a child. She then started to design on her own again, more seriously this time, creating a tech-friendly bag with an in-built protective sleeve for a laptop, which was well received amongst her peers. It was as stylish as it was functional, and the positive feedback was just the push she needed to follow her instincts and start her own business. Kempton & Co. was born in Brooklyn in 2010. Fiona’s heritage is a main inspiration. She designs bags with soft leathers and textiles juxtaposed with the utility of equestrian hardware. She prides herself in always maintaining an artistic approach to function; it is a philosophy that the company strives to maintain with each and every bag. Fiona lives in Brooklyn with her husband and daughter. An avid kiteboarder, surfer and sailor she spends each summer weekend afloat her sailboat in the Hamptons, which naturally led to the creation of her urban beach bag collection.

Londontown USA|     The story of Londontown begins in a grandmother's small flower garden in Radlett, England. In an effort to hydrate hands and nails, she hand-picked and blended flower oils and botanicals to create a healing remedy that restores moisture and ensures protection from the crisp, dry English air. Years later, I was reminded of our cherished family remedy while trying to safely restore my nails after noticing extensive damage from UV gel use. I tried countless products and solutions but could not find a safe and effective regimen until I implemented our family's healing remedy into my nail care routine. After seeing how quickly my nails restored to their pregel days and realizing that it was the nourishing properties of natural botanicals I realized that I must share our family remedy with the men and women, who like me are in search of a thoughtful and holistic approach to nail care. After all, why should safe and nourishing ingredients be reserved for skincare, our nails deserve just as much. With a modern sophisticated concept in mind, I combined nail care science with the restorative properties of Britain’s rapeseed flower oil, chamomile, cucumber and other essential extracts to bring you products that go beyond the surface and provide care to the entire nail. Our family remedy, now known as Florium Complex, is infused into both kur, our luxe nail care system, and lakur, our superior nail color collection. Florium Complex' exclusive blend of vitamins and botanical oils restores, hydrates and strengthen nails from within, improving nail quality and manicure length with every application.
Loomstate|     A few years ago we asked ourselves "Can we make a truly sustainable T shirt out of organic cotton? Can we make a best-practice, ethical, environmentally sound garment?" We set out to find the answer... We started with our organic cotton farms. Some were owned by factories, others by communities, but they all share in the same sustainable benefits: Soil Security, Farmer Knowledge, and Organic Food Potential. But was one farmer more sustainable than another? We were looking for REAL sustainable, for the full environmental and social potential that organic cotton can achieve. So we looked deeper. For a fiber that you plant every year to be sustainable, the whole system of influences that allows that fiber to be planted, picked and tended needs to be maintained season after season. It's not about soil health, food growing, or farming knowledge. It's about community that can support a farm and farmers year after year. The best communities from the world's most sustainable cotton. We set out to find them!

Having worked in the fashion industry for over 15 years, our founder Shelley understood how the right clothes had the power to make the modern woman feel confident, capable and beautiful.

Marie Turnor|     Marie Turnor Accessories is a Los Angeles-based handbag and accessories company from designer Beth Goodman. The classic style of Marie Turnor embraces timelessness over trendiness in the spirit of finding beauty in everyday things - a paper bag, an envelope, the colors of nature. The brand's essence lies in the realization that practical things are also exquisite. Beth Goodman was born in New York with an innate ability to make things beautiful. She studied art in London before attending the Fashion Institute of Technology for textile and fashion design. After graduation she launched the lingerie company Sabeth-Row, where her award-winning designs were featured in publications such as Vogue and W. She traveled frequently to Europe for both work and pleasure before eventually relocating to Los Angeles to style in advertising, music, and film. As a stylist, Beth became known for her classic and timelessly chic eye, which later became the foundation for Marie Turnor Accessories. Drawn once again to her love of textiles and making things, Beth found herself attracted to handbag and wallet designs and thus the Marie Turnor brand was born in 2009. Gaining inspiration from unexpected yet everyday objects, Beth’s early designs quickly gained a cult-like following. The Picnic clutch, a best-seller, was conceived when Beth spotted an elegant woman in Paris walking down the street with a paper bag in her hand, while the Idea bag was designed out of necessity after carrying samples in an Ikea bag. The brand currently offers a range of products, from Lunches, Dinners and Snaks, three variations on the best-selling Picnic, to wallets and handbags. Today, Marie Turnor can be found in premium boutiques around the world as well as online at www.marieturnor.com. As always, Marie Turnor is committed to quality and individuality; and all products are proudly made in Southern California by skilled craftspeople.

From the start an energy transformed the small workshop of handmade shirts into a planning think-tank. A powerful idea: to create a unique style consisting of a sophisticated normality which, in its simplicity and balance, might always have an eclectic and metropolitan touch. Critics and the market jumped: a new Italian brand had been born. Soon shirts became just one element of a total look encompassing the collections for men, women, children, and accessories. This was followed by the opening of single-brand stores in Italy and abroad. Front covers and red carpets from London to Moscow, Dubai, and the Palazzo di Santo Spirito in Milan. Today Mauro Grifoni is the real ambassador for an iconic and contemporary Italian style, under the creative direction of Ilaria Sesso, one that can wed rigor to classical perfection, the quality of materials, finishing, and artisanal handicraft with all the stimuli, codes, and turmoil of the international underground.

Miaou|     Miaou Jeans began with one pair that was inspired by a high-end Paris thrift store find back in 2000. Like most ready-to-wear denim, they were made to fit the tall and narrow women who model them on the runways. Discouraged by the lack of options, vintage collector-turned-designer Alexia Elkaim experimented by tailoring a cropped cut on her close friends— they fit so well that she knew she was on to something. So she created a garment that would be as well-constructed as the French classics she found while thrifting, but with a universally modern fit.

We collaborate closely with local knitters and seamstresses drawing on their expertise while supporting local industries and art forms. Born and raised in a quiet suburb outside of Detroit, Karen and Marie grew up cultivating a love for art and fashion. Their Italian grandparents - one, a master dressmaker, the other, a shoemaker and inventor - were their greatest influences. With unlimited access to their grandparent’s sewing supplies and workspace, they spent most of their free time fabricating their imaginative ideas. Inheriting a love for meticulous craft and innovation, the two went on to further refine their skills. Marie earned a Bachelor Degree in Fine Art and then a Masters Degree in Fashion and Knitwear Design from the Academy of Art University. She was granted a CFDA Scholarship for emerging student designers and her final collection debuted at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week in New York City. She also won the prestigious Avant-Garde Gen Arts International Styles Award in 2008. Karen earned a Bachelors Degree in Industrial Engineering, then went on to study Fashion Design and Patternmaking at FIDM. She then spent 7 years designing for Levi Strauss & Co.

Mini Shatsu|     Mini Shatsu began over thirty years ago with a boy and some unassuming white cotton tees. With rows of stacked cardboard boxes as his makeshift workstation, and cans of spray paint and Sharpies in hand, that boy went to work and dreamed up some of the coolest tee shirts E-V-E-R! ﻿ Growing up in the 80's near Hollywood, where everything was larger than life, there certainly was no shortage of inspirations when it came to designing tee shirts. All one needed to do was step outside, look, and listen. From rap to rock, beatbox to breaking, hoops to skateboarding, mohawks to tattoos, those that did it right, did it big. Big hair, big earrings, "gi-normous" boom boxes, loud music, and even louder outfits. In those days, bigger was indeed better. And original and homemade tees were big and loud in a quirky kind of way. Over the years tee shirts have evolved to become the canvas of choice for many looking for a creative outlet. After over a decade in the baby and juvenile products industry, the boy found himself gravitating back towards that tee shaped canvas. The nostalgia of it all led him back to where he first started... and started he did. A line called Mini Shatsu was born. "Shatsu" is a Japanese word meaning "shirt". Mini Shatsu or "mini shirt" is not just another line of tee shirts for kids and babies. It is, rather, a line of life-inspired clothing brought down to size to fit the most prized members of your family. While the shirts are no longer homemade or one-of-a-kind, Mini Shatsu shirts are still very unique and very limited, usually with only a few hundred shirts produced for each design.
Ministry of Supply|     What if the innovation was actually focused on making the experience of wearing the product better? Ministry of Supply was founded in 2012 to answer this question. We believe that clothing is both an expression of our identity and ideas, and an extension of the body, where form and function intersect. Our mission is to design and construct garments true to the form of the body, so we can unlock the body’s innate potential, leaving one truly unrestricted to focus on their daily pursuits. We are striving to achieve this through an iterative design process that combines a deep understanding of the human body with advanced materials and manufacturing processes. Our human-centric approach has helped us unearth basic truths that govern how we can make the body more comfortable in clothing through research like pressure mapping to understand the ideal location of cushioning, thermography to locate hot spots, and strain analysis to understand the dynamics of how our skin stretches. This has allowed us to create products that outperform their traditional contemporaries. Our goal through it all is this perfect union between clothing and the human body, so to the wearer, the two feel almost indistinguishable.

Misc. Goods Co.|     I didn’t intend to start a product company. I left my salary job as an in-house graphic designer to pursue the world of free-lance, jobs were coming in and I felt ready. But, as it’s known to go for people who choose this path, the carpet was ever beneath me waiting to be tugged. One day I showed up to my office and there was no work to do. And with a wife and two kids at home, I couldn’t be idle — my conscience just wouldn’t let me. So, as a discipline for the mind and an opportunity to sharpen my skills, I began designing a single playing card, the jack of spades. It turned out pretty well. The next day I showed up and still no work. So I designed the queen of spades. After three feverish months of this pattern, still workless, I had to my suprise finished designing an entire deck of playing cards. I was flat broke. Totally broke. Like, my friend lent me $1,200 to keep my lights on and feed my family type of broke. I was a bit of a mess. I was working hard, but with no income to show for it. It was at this low point that I asked my officemates to help me put together a pitch video (which you can watch below) and launched a Kickstarter campaign to produce the playing cards I had illustrated by happen-stance. “I had designed an entire deck of playing cards and was completely flat broke. Like totally broke. Like, ...” The video came together nicely. It communicated clearly what I did and what I needed. I asked for $6,250 to cover a minimum manufacturing order. And I was completely ready for the project to fail. I had been cooped up, alone with this project for so long that I had no idea how people would react. As some of you know, I reached my goal. Actually, I reached my goal with in 24 hours, and by the end of the campaign, I received a remarkable amount of $146,000. A great joy and weight descended onto me: My work had made a great impact on so many people, I was financially strong, but I had also promised my backers a quick turn around. There was so much work to be done. I started the manufacturing process the day after my Kickstarter campaign was secured. I built a team for fulfilment and operations, which was a rag-tag team of friends. The process was heavy. It was long. It was around the clock. But, it was successful. We printed, packaged and shipped more than 4,000 orders in the course of 40 days. Misc. Goods Co. had launched. It was now an actual company in the market place, and I had a platform to show my ideas. From there, I started to reinvest most of my Kickstarter earnings into creating new products. I was ready to explore what else I could make, and see how people would respond. My next products were the second edition decks, a hard case, a wallet and a flask. I created an online store and put the new products on the site. The following months were steady and uneventful. I made sales and the brand was well received, but MGCO was still a hobby for me; I wasn’t pushing it. Free lance graphic design was still how I paid the bills. In November, event organizer Rusty Meadows gave me two tickets to attend a commerce startup conference in Brooklyn called “Nearly Impossible.” The timing was providential. I used the trip test my future: either I would walk away from MGCO and allow it to fade away, or I would stop treating the MGCO as an outlet for my spare time and start treating it like a primary business. The conference served me well. My wife and I listened to men and women as they shared stories of starting their companies. They were candid and honest. I felt less like an outsider to the “startup” world; other companies are much like mine, and share the same struggles. A whole spectrum of people shared appreciation for my products and many of them encouraged me to push harder, to carve out a place in my life to pursue MGCO more intentionally. One of those people was Kiel Mead. At the time, Kiel led a creative cooperative called the American Design Club. A company of creatives and entrepreneurs who were young to the industry, who shared expenses and contacts as opportunity arose. One of these opportunities was to share a booth space at big trade show event in New York called “NYNOW.” This was my next opportunity to test the strength of the MGCO products. So I bought a ticket to NYC, asked a friend if I could crash on his spare bed and spent nine long days commuting from Brooklyn to Manhattan to pitch my products to buyers from all kinds of different places. Some owned small boutique shops across the world, others represented major retail companies. The experience, although taxing, strengthened my resolve. I own a company, people like it and it appears to have room to grow. I am undeserving and thankful. Now it’s time again to roll up my sleeves, and make the most out of this opportunity.

Nili Lotan|     "Fashion is about change and evolution, based on one's personal references and point of view. We express ourselves creatively through the clothes we propose and wear. I believe in individual expression through contrast and contradiction. Therefore, I offer variations of style and texture that may be eclectically combined to reflect a woman's personal style, mood, or attitude." — Nili Nili's simple design philosophy is pure and sophisticated. A woman's wardrobe should reﬂect her lifestyle, and function as an extension of who she is. Her vision is married to the idea that style comes from within and is experiential.

Obey|     OBEY Clothing was founded on the art, design and ideals of Shepard Fairey. What started for Fairey with an absurd sticker he created in 1989 while studying at the Rhode Island School of Design has since evolved into a worldwide street art campaign, as well as an acclaimed body of fine art. The OBEY campaign is rooted in the Do It Yourself counterculture of punk rock and skateboarding, but it has also taken cues from popular culture, commercial marketing and political messaging. Fairey steeps his ideology and iconography in self-empowerment. With biting sarcasm verging on reverse psychology, he goads viewers, using the imperative “obey,” to take heed of the propagandists out to bend the world to their agendas. OBEY Clothing was formed in 2001 as an extension of Shepard’s range of work. Aligned with his populist views, clothing became another canvas to spread his art and message to the people. The clothing is heavily inspired by classic military design, work wear basics, as well as the elements and cultural movements Shepard has based his art career on. Through designers Mike Ternosky and Erin Wignall, Shepard works to create designs that represent his influences, ideals and philosophy.

Rather than adhering to trends, the brand builds upon it’s vocabulary of forms and materials each season, creating a continual dialogue from one season to the next.

Original Penguin|     If a 100-year-old underwear factory in Minnesota seems an unconventional starting point for a fashion icon that has represented Americana since 1955 and is still worn all over the world today, blame Pete the Penguin. And perhaps a whiskey or two.Abbot Pederson was an ambitious salesman who worked for the Munsingwear undergarment factory in Minneapolis. On a sales trip to NYC in 1955, with some time to kill before a flight home, he decided to pop into a local bar. Stumbling out later to find a taxi stand, he took a wrong turn down a Manhattan street and found himself outside a taxidermist’s shop, staring at a display of stuffed penguins. Before he knew it, he had bought one of the penguins, named him Pete, and was soon enjoying cocktails with him on the flight back to Minneapolis.At some point during the flight, Pederson's enthusiasm got the better of him -- and he accidentally knocked the head off Pete the Penguin. A seductive stewardess, whose attention Pederson had been enjoying throughout the flight, gently helped him remove his tie, then wrapped it around the penguin's neck. As she did so, she joked that such a lucky, dapper bird surely deserved to be immortalized -- maybe even embroidered on a shirt similar to the one Pederson was wearing. Little did she know...On his return to Minneapolis, Pederson, a keen golfer, wasted no time merging his interests. And so the Munsingwear golf shirt was born. Casual, comfortable, equally at home on the 18th hole ... or the 19th hole … even in 1955 it was ahead of its time. From the moment it hit the shelves it was a must-have, popular with suburbanites and sports legends alike. Known today as "the 55," it represented not only a relaxed and sophisticated lifestyle but was to become the cornerstone of an entire fashion movement.

Pursoma®|     The name Pursoma comes from ‘pur’ - French for pure - and ‘soma’ – a Greek term meaning of the body. The Ayurvedic term ‘soma’ means something in and of the body that allows you to access your inner soul. Therefore, it is the integral part of transition, both physically and spiritually. Pursoma beauty wellness products offer a respite from the stressors of the modern world and serve to combat urban toxicity. The treatments are developed with the understanding that a path to wellness involves the process of self care through cleansing, detoxification, and nourishment to ultimately reach a stage of rejuvenation. WHAT INSPIRED PURSOMA®? Pursoma was founded in 2014 by Shannon Vaughn, a former model with a lifelong passion for health and wellness. Her world travels and education have inspired her natural remedies and she has created a line based on the principles of detoxification and rejuvenation. The catalyst for Pursoma was Shannon’s effective holistic approach to treating her own internal illness. These alternative therapies focused on detox and succeeded where traditional methods (i.e., prescription drugs and surgery) had failed. Following her recovery, Shannon worked closely with a nutritionist and biochemist to formulate potent, effective detox treatments that left her feeling vibrant and alive. It was this process of ‘soma’ - or transition - to wellness, along with the understanding she gained about what it means to be truly healthy that inspired her. Thus Shannon created Pursoma and the tools to practice self care and clean living to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Shannon has worked and studied all over the globe. She holds a BA in philosophy and ancient math and sciences from St. John’s College. She has completed studies in complementary and alternative medicine, the science of detoxification, and raw food and juicing at some of America’s top alternative medicine and wellness institutions. Her studies in India focused on Ayurvedic medicine, yogic philosophy and meditation as a treatment for PTSD. Shannon’s vast expertise ensures that her beauty wellness products are effective, natural remedies that keep you well in the modern world.

That experience inspired me to create the pieces that make up the core of my collection."

SKIN|     Skin was founded by Susan Beischel in 2003 to fill a perceived void in the marketplace for sensual, cotton, lingerie and loungewear.

You can do your work out in it, go to lunch in it, take the kids to school, walk the dog, or fall asleep in skin. Working in primarily organic pima cotton, we strive for a completely organic collection each season.

An eminent team was assembled, including independent leading research and practicing dermatologists throughout the United States. After years of disappointment from existing products that did not perform to expectation, Somme Institute was created with the intention of making perfect skin an attainable goal. Our Clinical Trials Clinical trials began testing ingredients to see what delivered results to the skin and what didn't. Through the use of Ultra Violet (UV) photography, participants' skin surface and subsurface conditions became visible. These advanced photographs enabled researchers to witness and analyze damage beneath the skin's surface-damage that would later appear in the form of dryness, wrinkles and uneven skin tone. After over 10 years of testing, development and "tracking" more than 5,000 participants, Somme Institute discovered and developed a technology called Molecular Dispersion Technology 5 (MDT5™).
Sonia Rykiel|     Rykiel… Six letters that are as snappy as a slogan spelled out in strass. It is the emblem of a love story begun in the whirlwind of an extraordinary Spring, which continues to this day. In May 1968, Sonia Rykiel founded her label and opened a first boutique on the rue de Grenelle, in Paris. It is the story of a designer who, starting in 1962, created knitwear pieces for the boutique Laura and, in unraveling her own desires, made the pullover into the signature for her own style. It is the hallmark of a terribly Parisian, terribly Saint Germain style, for which the designer became not only an ambassadress but a living incarnation. Anointed “Queen of Knits” by the American trade newspaper Women’s Wear Daily in 1970, Rykiel quickly went on to invent inside-out stitching, “hemless” and “no lining” dressing that reflected her new fashion philosophy, la démode (unfashion).

Sperry|     It was a simple invention born of necessity. Our founder, Paul Sperry, was an avid sailor with a passion for adventure. He was an inventor, an intrepid explorer. An independent spirit enamored with the power, freedom, and the unlimited possibilities of the sea. He was faced with a real-life problem that stood in the way of his passion: How to maintain traction on a slippery boat deck. No solution existed in 1935. Paul found his inspiration from his best friend: his dog Prince. Noticing that he did not slip on ice, he turned to Prince’s paw over to find hundreds of small cracks and lines going in all directions. These became the inspiration behind his inventive non-slip sole and the world’s first performance boat shoe. In that moment of inspiration, he not only created an icon, he launched a brand: the perfect union of an inventive idea, a man, his passion, and the allure of the sea.

Tarin Thomas|     ABOUT THE DESIGNER Toronto native Kylie Nakao has held a life long love and appreciation for adornment. Jewelry is a particular passion, as much for its ability to communicate emotional resonance for the owner as for its indelible statement to the sensibility of the wearer. At New York’s prestigious Parsons School of Art & Design, Kylie honed her knowledge of elevated design and her skill in articulating her aesthetic through different mediums. Yet, it was not until she became chief buyer for a trendy upscale NYC boutique did the idea of merging skill and experience begin to take shape into what would become her first and signature collection. Upon reviewing the collections of hundreds of jewelry vendors every season, Kylie saw the lack of cool, sophisticated, real jewelry that could be easily incorporated with signature pieces at an accessible price point. Deciding to develop a sample line of rings she wished for, her sample prototypes were bought directly off of her fingers, with immediate orders for more, and the Tarin Thomas Collection was born. Creatively inspired by the city she calls home, Kylie lives on NYC’s Lower East Side, and works at her studio close by. She now devotes her full creative resources to TT, and to the art of adorning others with new tales to tell. ABOUT THE BRAND Tarin Thomas champions the fusion of fine jewelry within the context of now. Offering a thoughtful approach to modern adornment: exploring the contrast between masculine and feminine, delicate and bold, modern and traditional. Designer Kylie Nakao’s jewelry melds artful, contemporary design with luxury materials to create pieces at once both elegant and fun. Launched for Spring of 2013, the Tarin Thomas brand is a response to the void in accessible, fine jewelry that communicates a clean modern aesthetic. Beginning with its signature “Stackable Collection,” the brand has grown to include a collection of earrings, delicate mid-finger rings, and the “Thomas Collection,” a unisex offering of bold minimal signet rings inspired by New York’s urban landscape. Handcrafted in New York City, the collection is produced in rose and yellow gold, silver, white gold filled wire, and yellow gold plated sterling silver set with premium quality stones such as sapphires, emeralds, quartz, cognac and black diamonds.

Photos with a life after the shutter clicks. Photos that develop in the palm of your hand, ready to pin to the wall or give to a friend. That’s why we’ve spent eight years working on our film formula. It’s why we’re reinventing analog instant photography in a digital world.

Thomas Paul|     Thomas Paul was born and raised in New York City. He got his start in the fashion business working as an intern at DKNY in the mid-nineties after, graduating from New York’s Fashion Institute of Technology with a degree in Textile Design. While working as a colorist and designer for a silk mill specializing in neckwear and scarves, he worked on neckwear collections for such designers as Bill Blass, Calvin Klein, and DKNY. This eventually led to the creation of his own neckwear collection, digities, in the late 90′s. From this was born the start of the thomaspaul pillow collection, launched in 2001, which was originally conceived of as an idea of utilizing the silk printing mill’s capabilities for home accessories instead of personal accessories. Since then the line has steadily expanded into other categories apart from silk pillows to includetabletop, stationery, and lamp shades. The ultimate goal being to have products covering every aspect of the home, all with thomaspaul patterns gracing them. "My vision for the thomaspaul brand has always been about combining classic design motifs from different periods in textile design. Incorporating anything from an 18th century Damask pattern to a camouflage print. The unifying thread between so many different styles is to change the designs so they are updated for today. For me this means changing the scale, so they are always bold, and reducing down the colors and details, so most designs are reduced to two or three colors and become very flat, bold prints. I am always looking to vintage fabrics and motifs for inspiration and new ideas, but always try to update these to look good for today." - Thomas

VPL|     VPL's mission is to empower women through its products and education.

VSSL|     A flashlight is one of the primary tools for camping, overnight outdoors or emergency/survival situations.

VSSL Outdoor Utility Tools were created to utilize that now obsolete space, while at the same time maintaining the practical form factor of the traditional torchlight. Our tool is intended to evolve. We’ve provided contents we feel are essential for challenging situations, but we are confident our customers will really see VSSL as just that; a container used to house items of importance to its owner.

Raab created the company after a successful career working for a number of leading fashion houses including Marc Jacobs and Adam Lippes. One constant companion over these years was her beloved Schnoodle, Benny. Always on the hunt for fun, colorful things for her pooch, she found herself disappointed with the choices in the market.

With that realization, she decided to take matters into her own hands and use her design know-how to develop her own line of products.

Wei|     Years back, in the heartland of China, a young tomboy found her joy in running around fields, climbing trees, digging in the dirt, picking herbs, and discovering their many uses. Her favorite afterschool activity was studying Traditional Chinese Medicine with herbal Doctor Li and she dreamed of someday winning a Nobel Prize for a modern application of TCM studies. Little did this girl know that as an adult TCM would save her son's life when western medicine saw little success in treating complicated medical conditions. Wei Brian’s love and appreciation for herbal medicine has led her to a profound and impassioned belief in TCM that she shares with everyone in her life, and it has inspired her to create the only prestige TCM beauty brand - Wei Beauty.
