In this context, the sisters Maria and Rosy Carita, two very determined and enterprising women, began offering all their talents to female beauty. Natives of Toulouse, they didn't shy away from the conventional ideas of their time, becoming the first female hairdressers in Paris. It was then, in 1945, when they installed their first salon in Paris, \"la Maison de Beauté\" a place that later became a symbol for hairdressing and the beauty salons. Their courage and creativity led them to collaborate with the young avant-garde fashion designers of the time, which eventually would become the great names in French Haute Couture. With all this, the Carita sisters have left us a precious legacy: a beauty mark of great success, endowed with great originality and commitment to luxury and professionalism. \nNowadays, the brand outstands by its unique methods in cosmetics and treatments thanks to the experience gained after several generations of scientists dedicated to the company. In this sense, its goals are focused on several distinct areas: clean the skin and free it from all impurity, prepare the skin carefully to be treated, correct the properties of the skin and provide it with the necessary nutrients, provide vitality and balance, and finally provide a protective layer that isolates it from external agents and pollution."}

Its success was immediate because it was the first range of cosmetics capable of acting deep into the skin, with visibly noticeable effects. Unfortunately, in Europe this is the only line that hasn't reached us, however Kanebo has numerous lines of cosmetic treatment at affordable prices, which are highly respected in their region of origin.\nAnother area in which this brand stands out is makeup. Kanebo makeup is exotic and extravagant out of the east, as it is influenced by the same character as their cosmetics in which \"the fineness and delicacy\" are the key to feminine beauty. This spirit is a legacy of the tradition of Japanese geishas, which today continue to cause a sensation in the West."}

{"brandName":"Montana","brandUrl":"https://www.perfumesclub.co.uk/en/montana/m/","brandDescription":"Claude Montana is a French designer of Catalan father and German mother, born in Paris in 1949. In the 60s it began his career selling papier-mâché jewelry in the London markets. In the early seventies he returned to his native Paris and began working with a manufacturer of leather and that's where he discovered one of his favorite materials: leather. In 1976 he presented his first fashion show with pieces of leather and metals, all very colorful and ahead of its time. In 1979 created his own brand: The House of Montana. During the 80s, along with Thierry Mugler and Jean Paul Gaultier, was a fashion icon with his sensual and aggressive forms, with huge shoulder pads and bright colors. In the '90s, in addition to designing for his maison, he did it also for Lanvin, one of the big houses, which is why he received two consecutive Golden Thimble awards. In 1997, the fashion house Montana broke due to poor management and was replaced by Dominique Morlotti. In 2002, Claude Montana presented his last fashion show and retired from public life. We must mention that he was a pioneer in creating his own line of Montana perfumes for men and for women, reaching a total of 21 fragrances and being the flagship, and the first, Montana Peau, launched in 1986 which was re-edited in 2011 due to its success over decades. In this same way, we find other legendary perfumes, such as Montana Blu and Montana 80's and they all exude a personality and sensuality characteristic of this iconic designer."}

The second of them developed the so-called Eucerit, an emulsion that made possible for water and oil to become a pioneering cosmetic: the cream. For its color, it arose the combination of the name of this world famous and iconic brand which comes from the Latin: nix (snow) and nivis (from the snow). The cream of the blue tin -which wasn't always of that color- has been, and is, a symbol that has passed from generation to generation. In 1922, it was launched a shaving soap and a balm. The advertising campaigns of Nivea began in 1924 with a photo of three boys that offered the desired image of a skin full of vitality and freshness. Already in 1925, the girls appeared on their campaigns. The headquarters of Nivea cosmetics production continues to be developed in Hamburg by the Beiersdorf laboratories, a giant that also has the property of other popular brands. This giant of cosmetics has researched and developed since then hundreds of innovative patents created specifically for the care and attention of our skin, as well as for our comfort: Nivea facial, Nivea Men, Nivea for baby care, deodorants, toiletry line, body care… They reach all market levels worldwide. Among the star products of Nivea we can find the line Q10, face and body creams that delay the aging of our skin by increasing the coenzyme Q10, which maintains the vitality and strength of the dermis. Another novelty was the body care Nivea In-Shower, a series of body milks which moisturize, reaffirm and nourish our bodies in depth while we take a shower, saving us time. We must highlight the care they have put into their sun care products having a wide range, where each skin needs finds its best partner.
