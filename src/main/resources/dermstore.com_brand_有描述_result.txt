The water of the flowers went unchanged for three days and, as he went to throw them away, the prior noticed that it had acquired a magnificent fragrance unknown to him. He went to the father alchemist, who traced the origin of this scent back to the \"Garofilium Silvestre Caprese\", a wild carnation native to the island. That water became the first fragrance of Capri.\n\nIn 1681, the Carthusian monks began to produce perfumes and medicines by distilling the plants, flowers and herbs cultivated in their botanical gardens, creating exceptional blends, more similar to those of today. In 1948 the prior of the Monastery discovered the old formulas of the perfumes and, by permission of the Pope, revealed them to a chemist from Torino, who created the smallest laboratory in the world and called it \"Carthusia\".\n\nThe limited production methods used by the Carthusian monks are still in practice today. Centuries-old knowledge flawlessly combines with natural, locally-sourced, highest quality proprietary ingredients, some hand-picked on Capri's Mount Solarno. And just as in the past, all production is carried out by hand, in small batches, to guarantee the accurate application of the methods involved and exquisite care of traditional craftsmanship."}

The oil is refined at USDA and FDA approved facilities and exceeds the \"fully refined\" standards, which eliminates impurities, bacteria and toxins.\nDremu's range of products can be used to alleviate pain associated with arthritis, carpel tunnel, and bug bites; eliminate dry skin, dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, and burns; increase collagen production, eliminate fine lines, and smooth and brighten the complexion; eliminate acne-causing bacteria, unclog pores, and diminish post-breakout scarring; and much more!"}

Working in podiatry for over 20 years has allowed him to gain extensive information on the many problems that ail the foot. Knowing that there wasn't an effecitve topical treatment for onychomycosis, a fungal infection of the nail that results in thick, yellow or cloudy nails, he and co-inventor Dr. Bert Rosenthal worked together to create Fungal Free Nails.\n\nThe Fungal Free Nails brand revolves around one amazing product, Fungal Free Nails. Dr. Marc Selner wanted to develop an easy-to-apply product that penetrates the nail without any side effects. The core of this product lies in the 12 fungicidal essential oils and a patented carrier system to treat onychomycosis. These powerful ingredients are naturally occurring and non-toxic, allowing the treatment to saturate underneath the nail, unlike other water-soluble treatments. Dr. Selner and Dr. Rosenthal have successfully created the first ever topical cure for onychomycosis and continue to receive much praise for its success rate."}

It all started when Karen Behnke, a serial wellness entrepreneur, who built one of the first corporate wellness companies in the country, developed a keen interest in personal care products upon becoming pregnant with her first child at the age of 40.\n\nExperiencing hormonal changes and the beginning of lines in her skin, Karen set out to find healthy skin care solutions that delivered visible results. She was astounded to learn that, although the skin absorbs over 60% of what is placed on it, there were very few available healthy personal care products that worked well. She wanted to create meaningful change in the beauty industry.\n\nYears after her second child was born, Karen subsequently bought the name Juice Beauty in 2004 and launched the Company from scratch in 2005. Karen set out to do the impossible: to create organic and natural formulations that perform as well as conventional beauty products yet never compromise on the luxurious experience. Over 5 years, Karen's team worked with PhD chemists, physicians, and microbiologists to perfect Juice Beauty's chemistry. Juice Beauty's revolutionary formulations started with a basic premise: Karen believed that by formulating with an antioxidant and vitamin-rich organic botanical juice base, rather than petroleum derivatives or added water, and combining it with powerful skin care ingredients, it could yield equal or better results than conventional or natural products. Multiple clinical testing proved her right. The company really started growing when the GREEN APPLE Peel now patented  escalated to fame through celebrity favorite mentions and media awards.\nToday, Juice Beauty offers award winning (InStyle, ELLE, Allure, EWG awards) skincare, makeup and hair care products that meet rigorous U.S., organic regulations supported by solid eco-values that include purchasing many ingredients locally from West Coast certified organic farmers and manufacturing strictly in the U.S.A. often with solar power, utilizing sustainable containers and printing with soy ink.

That fact is one of the many reasons why Rob Lowe spent 6 years catering to a men's only skin care line. PROFILE™ stays true to its initial mission statement: \"provable results\" and \"ingredients that actually work.\" Lowe makes a point to translate PROFILE™'s true-to-form attitude across the board. Eliminating sexy-sounding marketing tactics and jargon, PROFILE™'s genius stems from understanding the behavior of men's skin.\n\nThe brand's purpose is to offer high-performance grooming products that deliver notable results. Testosterone makes men's skin 20% oilier than women. Pores are also larger, oil glands are smaller and perspiration is more frequent in men. PROFILE™'s exclusive R3 proprietary formulas tackle men-specific skin care needs. Soothing and calming skin post shave while imparting invigorating hydration and blurring away signs of age, R3 was crafted with these specifics in mind. All products in the line are certified toxic-free, no added water, utilize highly concentrated ingredients and are held to the strictest quality standards through dermatologist testing.\n\nPROFILE™ is rooted in Lowe's belief in the importance of skin maintenance and the lapse of approachable, male-oriented brands. While working on the set of his hit show \"Parks and Recreation\", Lowe honed in his entrepreneurial spirit and began building PROFILE™ from the ground up. Lowe sought to make the same professional-grade products he uses backstage accessible to the general audience. As the developer, founder and chief executive officer, Lowe personally nurtures PROFILE™'s success."}
